This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### ðŸŽ¨ Desgin principles 
- **Separation of Concerns**: custom hooks for logic, components for UI.
- **Functional Component Design**: favor pure, stateless components.
- **Custom Hooks Pattern**: encapsulate logic like forms, fetching, and auth.
- **Context + Provider Pattern**: for global state (auth, language, theme).
- **Atomic Design**: organize UI as atoms, molecules, organisms.
- **Folder-by-Feature Structure**: maintainable directory layout.
- **Composition over Inheritance**: pass props and children for flexibility.
- **SOLID Principles** for class and logic design.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: views, serializers, services, and models clearly separated.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: reusable utilities, mixins, and service layers.
- **Fat Models, Thin Views**: business logic prioritized in models or service layers.
- **YAGNI and KISS**: only build what is needed, keep logic simple.
- **Clean Architecture Inspiration**: structured as domain-driven with optional `services/`, `repositories/`, and
