### ðŸŽ¨ Desgin principles 
- **Separation of Concerns**: custom hooks for logic, components for UI.
- **Functional Component Design**: favor pure, stateless components.
- **Custom Hooks Pattern**: encapsulate logic like forms, fetching, and auth.
- **Context + Provider Pattern**: for global state (auth, language, theme).
- **Atomic Design**: organize UI as atoms, molecules, organisms.
- **Folder-by-Feature Structure**: maintainable directory layout.
- **Composition over Inheritance**: pass props and children for flexibility.
- **SOLID Principles** for class and logic design.
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: views, serializers, services, and models clearly separated.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: reusable utilities, mixins, and service layers.
- **Fat Models, Thin Views**: business logic prioritized in models or service layers.
- **YAGNI and KISS**: only build what is needed, keep logic simple.
- **Clean Architecture Inspiration**: structured as domain-driven with optional `services/`, `repositories/`, and
